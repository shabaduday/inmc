# inmc
inmc or ILENDSYS is a loan management system website that allows users to lend and pay efficiently. This is an unfinished project, but currently working on it as this was proposed by my client. There are two version of this system: v1 and v2.

# v1
This version is my client's old website, but mostly made it with manual coding. It has no bootstrap framework and plugins, but has a database to make the website work.

# v2
This version is the upgraded which includes bootstrap framework and javascript plugins, but no database yet. I just download free bootstrap template from internet and merge my code with it.
